        I am a mathematician and web developer specialized in JS frontend
        technologies. I am into web development for 5 years now and have 2 years
        of work experience as frontend developer in corporate environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can quickly switch between all 3 mainstream frontend frameworks
        (Angular, Vue and React) with Vue being my favorite and React the most
        recent I used. At first, I was learning PHP while creating one of my
        personal projects and that's when I gained a solid understanding of SQL
        database structures and other stuff backend developers are concerned
        about. This knowledge gives me a broader picture of projects I work on,
        occasionally gets me some valuable insight and improves quality of
        communication with backend developers I work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value excellence, learning, teamwork and love for what I am doing.
        Improving myself and using that to improve others is what I think good
        life is about. I actively nurture these values so it is important to me
        that the company I am a part of nurtures these values as well.
